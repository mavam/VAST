We are moving our community chat from Slack to Discord. Why? TL;DR: because
Discord has better support for community building. VAST is not the first project
that abandons Slack. [Numerous][meilisearch] [open-source][appwrite]

:::info Discord Invite Link
You can join our Discord community chat via <https://vast.io/discord>.
:::

Here are the top four reasons why we are switching:

- **Retention**: Slack's free plan has only 90 days message retention. We prefer
  permanence of our community discussion.

- **Moderation**: Discord has solid moderation tools that rely on role-based
  access, and makes it possible adhere to our [Code of
  Conduct](/docs/contribute/code-of-conduct) upon joining.

- **Invitation**: Unlimited invite links that do not expire.

- **Inclusion**: Users can self-assign their preferred pronouns.

We hope that the majority of our Slack users understand these concerns and
will join us over at Discord. See you there!
