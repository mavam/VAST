# AWS

:::caution Experimental
VAST's native cloud architecture is still highly experimental and
subject to change without notice.
:::

Running VAST on AWS relies on two serverless building blocks:

1. [Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) for VAST server nodes
2. [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) as compute service to perform tasks,
   such as executing queries and ingesting data ad hoc

For storage, VAST uses [EFS](https://aws.amazon.com/efs/). The sketch below
illustrates the high-level architecture:

![AWS Architecture](aws-architecture.excalidraw.svg)

## Create an environment file

:::info Source Code Required
Make sure you have [downloaded the VAST source code](/docs/setup/download)
and change into the directory
[cloud/aws](https://github.com/tenzir/vast/tree/master/cloud/aws) that contains
all deployment scripts.
:::

Prior to running the deployment scripts, you need to setup required envionment
variables in a `.env` in the `cloud/aws` directory:

- `VAST_AWS_REGION`: the region of the VPC where to deploy Fargate and Lambda
  resources.

- `VAST_PEERED_VPC_ID`: an existing VPC to which you plan to attach your VAST stack.
  You can use `aws ec2 describe-vpcs --region $region` to list available VPCs.
  The deployment script will create a new VPC and peer it to the existing one.

- `VAST_CIDR`: the IP range where the VAST stack will be placed. Terraform will
  create a new VPC with this CIDR, so it should not overlapp with any of your
  existing VPCs.

Optionally, you can also define the following variables:

- `VAST_VERSION`: the version of VAST that should be used. By default it is set
  to the image tagged as `latest`. Can be any tag available on the tenzir/vast
  Dockerhub as long as it is more recent than `v1.1.0`. You can also build from
  source using `build`.

- `VAST_STORAGE_TYPE`: the type of volume to use for the VAST server and other
  tasks where persistence is useful. Can be set to either
  - `EFS` (default): persistent accross task execution, infinitely scalable, but
    higher latency.
  - `ATTACHED`: the local storage that comes by default with Fargate tasks, lost
    lost when the task is stopped.

Here's an example:

```bash
VAST_PEERED_VPC_ID=vpc-059a7ec8aac174fc9
VAST_CIDR=172.31.48.0/24
VAST_AWS_REGION=eu-north-1
```

## Spin up infrastructure with Terraform

Once you have a `.env` file set up, you can deploy to AWS. To spin up the AWS
infrastructure, we use [Terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/), a thin
[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) wrapper to keep a DRY configuration.

In case you are not familiar using these tools, we package the toolchain in a
small [Docker image][vast-cloud-dockerfile], wrapped behind a tiny shell
script [`vast-cloud`][vast-cloud-script]. The script builds the Docker container
on first use. You can trigger a manual build as well:

```bash
VASTCLOUD_REBUILD=1 ./vast-cloud
```

With the toolchain Docker image in place, `vast-cloud` is now ready to execute
commands via `docker run` that transports the `.env` configuration to the main
script [`main.py`][main.py] driving the Terragrunt invocation. To see what
commands are available, run `./vast-cloud --list`.

To create the AWS services, run:

```bash
./vast-cloud deploy
```

To tear everything down, use:

```bash
./vast-cloud destroy
```

[core.py]: https://github.com/tenzir/vast/blob/master/cloud/aws/cli/core.py

:::warning Caveats
- Access to the VAST server is enforced by limiting inbound traffic to its local
  private subnet.
- A NAT Gateway and a network load balancer are created automatically, you
  cannot specify existing ones. They will be billed at [an hourly
  rate](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/pricing/) even when you aren't running any
  workload, until you tear down the entire stack.
:::

:::tip Get modules back in sync
Terragrunt sometimes fails to detect when it must run `terraform init`. When
that happens, you can force an init on all modules using `./vast-cloud init`.
:::

### Start a VAST server (Fargate)

Now that the AWS infrastructure is in place, you start the containers. To start
a VAST server as Fargate task, run:

```bash
./vast-cloud vast.start-server
```

By default, this launches the official `tenzir/vast` Docker image and executes
the command `vast start`. To use the VAST Pro image, check out the [AWS
Pro](/docs/setup/deploy/aws-pro) documentation.

Check the status of the running server with:
```bash
./vast-cloud vast.server-status
```

You can replace the running server with a new Fargate task:
```bash
./vast-cloud vast.restart-server
```

Finally, to avoid paying for the Fargate resource when you are not using VAST, you can shut down the server:
```bash
./vast-cloud stop-vast-server
```

:::info
- If you use `ATTACHED` as storage type, restarting the server task will wipe
  the database.
:::

### Run a VAST client on Fargate

After your VAST server is up and running, you can start spawning clients.
The `vast.server-execute` target lifts VAST command into an ECS Exec operation. For
example, to execute `vast status`, run:

```bash
./vast-cloud vast.server-execute --cmd "vast status"
```

If you do not specify the `cmd` option, it will start an interactive bash shell.
This comes handy to inspect the server environment and check whether things are
up and running.

:::note
The Fargate task should be in `RUNNING` state and you sometime need a few extra
seconds for the ECS Exec agent to start.
:::

### Run a VAST client on Lambda

To run a VAST client from Lambda, use the `vast.lambda-client` target:

```bash
./vast-cloud vast.lambda-client --cmd "vast status"
```

The Lambda image also contains extra tooling, such as the AWS CLI, which is
useful to run batch imports or exports to other AWS services.

## Configure and deploy cloud plugins

You can set activate a number of "cloud plugins" using the `.env` config file:
```
VAST_CLOUD_PLUGINS = workbucket,tests
```

### Continuously load data from Cloudtrail

If you have Cloudtrail enabled and pushing data into a bucket that is located in
the same AWS account as your VAST deployment, you can deploy an optional module
that will stream all the new events arriving in that bucket to the VAST
instance. To achieve this, assuming that VAST is already deployed, configure the
following in the `.env` file:
- `VAST_CLOUD_PLUGINS`: add `cloudtrail` to the list of plugins
- `VAST_CLOUDTRAIL_BUCKET_NAME`: the name of the bucket where Cloudtrail is
  pushing its events
- `VAST_CLOUDTRAIL_BUCKET_REGION`: the region where that bucket is located

Then run:

```bash
./vast-cloud deploy
```

You should see new events flowing into VAST within a few minutes:

```bash
./vast-cloud vast.lambda-client -c "vast count '#type==\"aws.cloudtrail\"'"
```

Running the global `./vast-cloud destroy` command will also destroy optional
modules such as the Cloudtrail datasource. If you want to destroy the Cloudtrail
datasource resources only, use:

```bash
./vast-cloud destroy --step cloudtrail
```

:::warning Caveats
- To get notified of new objects in the bucket, we use EventBridge
  notifications. These notifications are not disabled automatically on your
  bucket when the stack is destroyed to avoid interfering with your existing
  notification systems.
:::

### Run MISP

[MISP](https://www.misp-project.org/) is a popular community driven open source
thread intelligence platform. It integrates naturally with VAST. To deployed a
preconfigured instance:
- add `misp` to the list of plugins in `VAST_CLOUD_PLUGINS`
- deploy (or re-deploy) the VAST stack including MISP with `./vast-cloud deploy`
- start the MISP server with `./vast-cloud misp.start`, wait a few minutes, MISP
  is rather slow to start :-)
- open an ssh tunnel to your instance running `./vast-cloud misp.tunnel`
- you can now connect to MISP `localhost:8080` on you local browser
  - Default login: demo@tenzir.com / demo
  - Default API KEY: demodemodemodemodemodemodemodemodemodemo
- you can also subscribe to MISP's ZeroMQ feed on `localhost:50000`

### Expose services publicly

We offer the capability to expose services securely using
Cloudflare Access. You need a Cloudflare account with a [zone
configured](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/setup/)
to use this plugin.
- add `cloudflare` to the list of plugins in `VAST_CLOUD_PLUGINS`
- configure the environment:
  - `VAST_CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`: the account ID is provided in the overview
    page of you zone
  - `VAST_CLOUDFLARE_ZONE`: the domain of you zone, e.g example.com
  - `VAST_CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`: an API token with
    - account permissions: `Cloudflare Tunnel:Edit`, `Access: Organizations,
      Identity Providers, and Groups:Edit`, `Access: Apps and Policies:Edit`
    - zone permissions:  `Access: Apps and Policies:Edit`, `DNS:Edit`
  - `VAST_CLOUDFLARE_EXPOSE`: comma separated list of output variables containing
    the local service URLs. Currently only `misp.ui_url` is supported
  - `VAST_CLOUDFLARE_AUTHORIZED_EMAILS`: comma seprated list of email addresses
    we want to authorize on the demo apps. Users will get access using [1 time
    PIN login](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/identity/one-time-pin/).
- deploy (or re-deploy) the VAST stack including the Cloudflare proxy with
  `./vast-cloud deploy`
- start the Cloudflare tunnel with `./vast-cloud cloudflare.start`
- configure the tunnel routes to the deployed apps by running `./vast-cloud
  cloudflare.setup`
- in the Cloudflare Zero Trust pannel,
  [configure](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/applications/configure-apps/self-hosted-apps/)
  the applications to protect the exposed endpoints
