## What is VAST?

VAST is an embeddable telemetry engine for structured event data, purpose-built
for use cases in security operations. VAST is an acronym and stands for
**Visibility Across Space and Time**.

Consider VAST if you want to:

- Store, aggregate, and manage massive amounts of security telemetry
- BYO data science and data engineering tools for security analytics
- Build a foundation for a federated detection and response architecture
- Operationalize threat intelligence and detect at the edge
- Empower threat hunters with a data-centric investigation tool

If you're unsure whether VAST is the right tool for your use case, keep reading.

## What's Next?

We organize the remainder of this documentation along the journey of a typical
user:

1. [Setup VAST](/docs/setup) describes how you can download, install, and
   configure VAST in a variety of environments.
   ðŸ‘‰ *Start here if you want to deploy VAST.*
2. [Use VAST](/docs/use) explains how to work with VAST, e.g., ingesting
   data, running queries, matching threat intelligence, or integrating it with
   other security tools.
   ðŸ‘‰ *Go here if you have a running VAST, and want to explore what you can do
   with it.*
3. [Understand VAST](/docs/understand) describes the system design goals
   and architecture, e.g., the actor model as concurrency and distribution
   layer, separation of read/write path, and core components like the catalog
   that provides light-weight indexing and manages schema meta data.
   ðŸ‘‰ *Read here if you want to know why VAST is built the way it is.*
4. [Develop VAST](/docs/develop) provides developer-oriented resources to
   work on VAST, e.g., write own plugins or enhance the source code.
   ðŸ‘‰ *Look here if you are ready to get your hands dirty and write code.*
