# ASCII

The `ascii` format renders data according to VAST's [value
syntax][expression-values]. A value is a data literal that makes easy to infer
its type. The main value is that it represents a maximally condensend view of
heterogeneous data. Think of it like NDJSON, but without field names.

[expression-values]: /docs/understand/language/expressions#values

For example, `1.2.3.4` is an IP address literal, whereas `"1.2.3.4"`
is a string literals. Type inference isn't always possible, e.g., in the case of
empty lists (`[]`).

## Printer

Use `export ascii` to render data in textual form:

```bash
vast export ascii '#type == /.*/'
```
