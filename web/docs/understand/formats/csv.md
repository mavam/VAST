# CSV

The `csv` format represents [comma-separated values
(CSV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) data in tabular
form. The first line in a CSV file is the header that describes the field names.
The remaining lines contain concrete values. One line corresponds to one event,
minus the header.

## Parser

To read CSV data, consider this piece of data:

```csv
ip,sn,str,rec.a,rec.b
1.2.3.4,10.0.0.0/8,foo bar,-4.2,/foo|bar/
```

As with [JSON](json), CSV still requires explicit [selection of a
schema](/docs/use/import/#map-events-to-schemas) via `--type` to understand the
field types corresponding the the column headers. Here's the corresponding
schema:

```go title=test.schema
type test = record{
  ip: ip,
  sn: subnet,
  str: string,
  rec: record{
    a: double,
    b: pattern
  }
}
```

You can now ingest the CSV input as follows:

```bash
vast import -s test.schema csv < file.csv
```

## Printer

To render data as CSV, use the `export csv` command:

```bash
vast export csv 1.2.3.4 '#type == /suricata.*/'
```

```csv

```

As with any variable-schema text output, it is complicated to interleave results
from different schemas. If VAST encouters a schema that differs from the
previously rendered one, it appends a new CSV header.

Nested records have dot-separated field names.
