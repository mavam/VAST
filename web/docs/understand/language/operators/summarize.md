# summarize

The `summarize` operator bundles input records according to a grouping
expression and applies an aggregation function over each group.

The extent of a group depends on the pipeline input. For import and export
pipelines, a group comprises a single batch (configurable as
`vast.import.batch-size`). For compaction, a group comprises an entire partition
(configurable as `vast.max-partition-size`).

## Synopsis

```
summarize [FIELD=]AGGREGATION(EXTRACTOR[, …])[, …] by EXTRACTOR[, …] [resolution DURATION]
```

### Aggregation Functions

Aggregation functions compute a single value of one or more columns in a given
group. Fields that neither occur in an aggregation function nor in the `by` list
are dropped from the output.

The following aggregation functions are available:
- `sum`: Computes the sum of all grouped values.
- `min`: Computes the minimum of all grouped values.
- `max`: Computes the maxiumum of all grouped values.
- `any`: Computes the disjunction (OR) of all grouped values. Requires the
  values to be booleans.
- `all`: Computes the conjunction (AND) of all grouped values. Requires the
  values to be booleans.
- `distinct`: Creates a sorted list of all unique grouped values that are not
  nil. If the values are lists, operates on the all values inside the lists
  rather than the lists themselves.
- `sample`: Takes the first of all grouped values that is not nil.
- `count`: Counts all grouped values that are not nil.

### Grouping

The `group-by` option specifies a list of
[extractors](/docs/understand/language/expressions#extractors) that
should form a group. VAST internally calculates the combined hash for all
extractors for every row and puts the data into buckets for subsequent
aggregation.

### Time Resolution

The `resolution` option specifies an optional duration value that specifies the
tolerance when comparing time values in the `group-by` section. For example,
`01:48` is rounded down to `01:00` when a 1-hour `resolution` is used.

## Example

Show all distinct `id.origin_port` values grouped by `id.origin_ip` values.

```
summarize distinct(id.origin_port) by id.origin_ip
```

Show all distinct `id.origin_port` values grouped by `id.origin_ip` values in
a field with the custom name `total_ports`.

```
summarize total_ports=distinct(id.origin_port) by id.origin_ip
```

Show the result of `any(Initiated)` grouped by the `SourceIp, SourcePort,
DestinationPoint` and `UtcTime` values, with an optional time resolution of one
minute.

```
summarize any(Initiated) by SourceIp, SourcePort, DestinationPoint, UtcTime resolution 1 minute
```

## YAML Syntax Example

:::info Deprecated
The YAML syntax is deprecated since VAST v3.0, and will be removed in a future
release. Please use the pipeline syntax instead.
:::

The `summarize` operator has grouping and aggregation options. The general
structure looks as follows:

```yaml
summarize:
  group-by:
    # inputs
  time-resolution:
    # bucketing for temporal grouping
  aggregate:
    # output 
```

There exist three ways to configure an aggregation function in the YAML syntax:

```yaml
# Long form: Specify a list of input extractors explicitly.
output_field_name:
  aggregation_function:
    - input_extractor_1
    - ...
    - input_extractor_n

# Long form: Specify a single input extractor.
output_field_name:
  aggregation_function: input_extractor

# Short form: Input extractor equals output field name.
output_field_name: aggregation_function
```

Here's a full example:

```yaml
summarize:
  group-by:
    - timestamp
    - proto
    - event_type
  time-resolution: 1 hour
  aggregate:
    timestamp_min:
      min: timestamp
    timestamp_max:
      max: timestamp
    pkts_toserver: sum
    pkts_toclient: sum
    bytes_toserver: sum
    bytes_toclient: sum
    start: min
    end: max
    alerted: any
    ips:
      distinct:
        - src_ip
        - dest_ip
```
