# Operators

Operators are the building block of [pipelines](../README.md). There exist three
types: *sources*, *sinks*, and *transformations*.

:::note Sources & Sinks
The current version VAST only ships with transformations. We are in the middle
of implementing sources (`from`/`read`) and sinks (`write`/`to`).

VAST comes with the following operators, in alphabetical order:

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
