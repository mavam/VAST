# Language

VAST comes with its own language for searching, reshaping, analyzing, and
routing data between various security tools.

We unpack the language facets in various topics:

1. [Pipelines](language/pipelines): the central abstractions for constructing dataflows
2. [Expressions](language/expressions): a declarative way to filter structured data
3. [Operators](language/operators): a reference of available pipeline operators
4. [Frontends](language/frontends): a mechanism to bring your own language
