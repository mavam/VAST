# Quickstart

Get up and running quickly with this tutorial. It just takes a few steps to run
pipelines.

## Explore the demo node

The easiest way to get started with Tenzir is using our cloud demo setup:

1. [Create a free account](installation/create-an-account.md) by signing in:

![Sign in](example-signin.png)

2. You will be redirected to the [Pipelines](https://app.tenzir.com/pipelines)
   page:

3. Create a demo node by clicking the *Add node* button in the left pane and
   select *Cloud-hosted demo node*. The demo node takes 1-2 minutes to boot up:

4. The demo node comes with the *Demo Node Pipelines* package from the library
   pre-installed. Head over to the *Library* page to view the installed package:

5. Let's run one of the snippets included with the demo package. This brings you
   right into the *Explorer*, where you can interactively run pipelines:

6. Start learning TQL and explore the data set visually, e.g., by running
   aggregations and [plotting data](operators/chart.md):

## Up next

Now that you got a first impression of Tenzir, [onboard your own
node](installation/deploy-a-node/README.md) and dive deeper by

- understanding [how Tenzir works](how-tenzir-works/README.md)
  other systems,
- following the [user guides](installation.md) with step-by-step tutorials
  of common use cases,
- learning more about the language, such as
  [statements](tql2/language/statements.md),
  [expressions](tql2/language/expressions.md), [operators](tql2/operators.md),
  [functions](tql2/functions.md) the [type
  system](tql2/language/types/README.md).
