# Integrations

An *integration* is a set of example pipelines to interface with an external
product. The objective of most integrations is to establish dataflow from and/or
to Tenzir using pipelines to implement common use cases.

Please read our [FAQ entry](faqs/README.md#do-you-have-an-integration-for-x) on
how to proceed if you cannot find the integration that you are looking for.
