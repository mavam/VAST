# Overview

### Tenzir is the data pipeline engine for security teams

![Before & After](before-and-after-tenzir-detailed.svg)

**Why Tenzir?** Tenzir decouples data acquisition from downstream analytics,
giving you full control over your data flows. By using Tenzir as your data
pipeline, you can streamline and trim your security events down to the essence,
significantly reducing SIEM costs.

**Building a security data lake?** Tenzir serves as your ETL layer, delivering
data as your lake requires it. Our growing [open-source library of
packages](https://github.com/tenzir/library) includes turn-key integrations for
popular security products and mappings to [OCSF](https://schema.ocsf.io). Don't
use your precious security resources to do mundane data plumbing. We got this.

**Join the community!** Tenzir is more than just software: it's a
community-driven open-source project. Contribute, collaborate, and
[join](/discord) our mission to make working with security simple and enjoyable!
