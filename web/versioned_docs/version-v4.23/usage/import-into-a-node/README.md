# Import into a node

Importing (or *ingesting*) data can be done by [running a
pipeline](../run-pipelines/README.md) that ends with the
[`import`](../../tql2/operators/import.md) sink operator. When managing a pipeline
through the app or the API, all pipeline operators run within the node. When
using the CLI, at least the `import` operator runs within the node.

Consider this example that takes a Zeek conn.log from our M57 dataset:

```tql
load_file "Zeek/conn.log"
read_zeek_tsv
select id.orig_h, id.resp_h, orig_bytes, resp_bytes
where orig_bytes > 1 Mi
import
```

The `import` operator requires a node execution context. To invoke the above
pipeline successfully, you need to [deploy a
node](../../installation/deploy-a-node.md) first.
