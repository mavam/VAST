# read_ssv

Read SSV (Space-Separated Values) from a byte stream.

```tql
read_ssv [list_sep=str, null_value=str, comments=bool, header=str, auto_expand=bool,
          schema=str, selector=str, schema_only=bool, raw=bool, unflatten=str]
```

## Description

The `read_ssv` operator transforms a byte stream into a event stream by parsing
the bytes as SSV.

### `auto_expand = bool (optional)`

Automatically add fields to the schema when encountering events with too many
values instead of dropping the excess values.

### `comments = bool (optional)`

Treat lines beginning with "#" as comments.

### `header = str (optional)`

The `string` to be used as a `header` for the parsed values.
If unspecified, the first line of the input is used as the header.

### `list_sep = str (optional)`

The `string` separating the elements _inside_ a list.

Defaults to `,`.

### `null_value = str (optional)`

The `string` denoting an absent value.

Defaults to `-`.

### `raw = bool (optional)`

Use only the raw types that are native to the parsed format. Fields that have a type
specified in the chosen `schema` will still be parsed according to the schema.

In the case of SSV this means that no parsing of data takes place at all
and every value remains a string.

### `schema = str (optional)`

Provide the name of a schema to be used by the
parser.

If a schema with a matching name is installed, the result will always have
all fields from that schema.
* Fields that are specified in the schema, but did not appear in the input will be null.
* Fields that appear in the input, but not in the schema will also be kept. `schema_only=true`
can be used to reject fields that are not in the schema.

If the given schema does not exist, this option instead assigns the output schema name only.

The `schema` option is incompatible with the `selector` option.

### `selector = str (optional)`

Designates a field value as schema name with an optional dot-separated prefix.

The string is parsed as `<fieldname>[:<prefix>]`. The `prefix` is optional and
will be prepended to the field value to generate the schema name.

For example, the Suricata EVE JSON format includes a field
`event_type` that contains the event type. Setting the selector to
`event_type:suricata` causes an event with the value `flow` for the field
`event_type` to map onto the schema `suricata.flow`.

The `selector` option is incompatible with the `schema` option.

### `schema_only = bool (optional)`

When working with an existing schema, this option will ensure that the output
schema has *only* the fields from that schema. If the schema name is obtained via a `selector`
and it does not exist, this has no effect.

This option requires either `schema` or `selector` to be set.

### `unflatten = str (optional)`

A delimiter that, if present in keys, causes values to be treated as values of
nested records.

A popular example of this is the [Zeek JSON](read_zeek_json.md) format. It includes
the fields `id.orig_h`, `id.orig_p`, `id.resp_h`, and `id.resp_p` at the
top-level. The data is best modeled as an `id` record with four nested fields
`orig_h`, `orig_p`, `resp_h`, and `resp_p`.

Without an unflatten separator, the data looks like this:

```json title="Without unflattening"
{
  "id.orig_h": "1.1.1.1",
  "id.orig_p": 10,
  "id.resp_h": "1.1.1.2",
  "id.resp_p": 5
}
```

With the unflatten separator set to `.`, Tenzir reads the events like this:

```json title="With 'unflatten'"
{
  "id": {
    "orig_h": "1.1.1.1",
    "orig_p": 10,
    "resp_h": "1.1.1.2",
    "resp_p": 5
  }
}
```

## Examples

### Parse an SSV file

```txt title="input.ssv"
message count ip
text 42 "1.1.1.1"
"longer string" 100 1.1.1.2
```

```tql
load "input.ssv"
read_ssv
```

```tql
{message: "text", count: 42, ip: 1.1.1.1}
{message: "longer string", count: 100, ip: 1.1.1.2}
```
