# read_ndjson

Parses an incoming NDJSON (newline-delimited JSON) stream into events.

```tql
read_ndjson [schema=str, selector=str, schema_only=bool,
            merge=bool, raw=bool, unflatten=str]
```

## Description

Parses an incoming NDJSON byte stream into events.

### `merge = bool (optional)`

Merges all incoming events into a single schema\* that converges over time. This
option is usually the fastest *for reading* highly heterogeneous data, but can
lead to huge schemas filled with nulls and imprecise results. Use with caution.

\*: In selector mode, only events with the same selector are merged.

### `raw = bool (optional)`

Use only the raw JSON types. This means that JSON numbers will be
parsed as numbers, but every string will remain a string, even if
they would be valid `ip`s or `duration`s.

If a known `schema` is given, fields will still be parsed according to the schema.

Use with caution.

### `schema = str (optional)`

Provide the name of a schema to be used by the parser.

If a schema with a matching name is installed, the result will always have
all fields from that schema.
* Fields that are specified in the schema, but did not appear in the input will be null.
* Fields that appear in the input, but not in the schema will also be kept. `schema_only=true`
can be used to reject fields that are not in the schema.

If the given schema does not exist, this option instead assigns the output schema name only.

The `schema` option is incompatible with the `selector` option.

### `selector = str (optional)`

Designates a field value as schema name with an optional dot-separated prefix.

The string is parsed as `<fieldname>[:<prefix>]`. The `prefix` is optional and
will be prepended to the field value to generate the schema name.

For example, the Suricata EVE JSON format includes a field
`event_type` that contains the event type. Setting the selector to
`event_type:suricata` causes an event with the value `flow` for the field
`event_type` to map onto the schema `suricata.flow`.

The `selector` option is incompatible with the `schema` option.

### `schema_only = bool (optional)`

When working with an existing schema, this option will ensure that the output
schema has *only* the fields from that schema. If the schema name is obtained via a `selector`
and it does not exist, this has no effect.

This option requires either `schema` or `selector` to be set.

### `unflatten = str (optional)`

A delimiter that, if present in keys, causes values to be treated as values of
nested records.

A popular example of this is the [Zeek JSON](read_zeek_json.md) format. It includes
the fields `id.orig_h`, `id.orig_p`, `id.resp_h`, and `id.resp_p` at the
top-level. The data is best modeled as an `id` record with four nested fields
`orig_h`, `orig_p`, `resp_h`, and `resp_p`.

Without an unflatten separator, the data looks like this:

```json title="Without unflattening"
{
  "id.orig_h": "1.1.1.1",
  "id.orig_p": 10,
  "id.resp_h": "1.1.1.2",
  "id.resp_p": 5
}
```

With the unflatten separator set to `.`, Tenzir reads the events like this:

```json title="With 'unflatten'"
{
  "id": {
    "orig_h": "1.1.1.1",
    "orig_p": 10,
    "resp_h": "1.1.1.2",
    "resp_p": 5
  }
}
```

## Examples

### Read a newline-delimited JSON file

```json title="versions.json"
{"product": "Tenzir", "version.major": 4, "version.minor": 22}
{"product": "Tenzir", "version.major": 4, "version.minor": 21}
```

```tql
load_file "versions.json"
read_ndjson unflatten="."
```

```tql
{
  product: "Tenzir",
  version: {
    major: 4,
    minor: 22,
  }
}
{
  product: "Tenzir",
  version: {
    major: 4,
    minor: 21,
  }
}
```
