# http

Loads and saves bytes via HTTP.

## Synopsis

```
http [--chunked] [--multipart] [-f|--form] [-j|--json] [-v|--verbose]
     [<method>] <url> [<item>..]
```

## Description

The `http` loader performs a HTTP request and returns the bytes of the HTTP
response body. The `http` saver performs a HTTP request with the request body
being the the provided bytes by the previous operator. The diagram below
illustrates how loader and saver work:

![HTTP Connector](http.excalidraw.svg)

We modeled the `http` connector after [HTTPie](https://httpie.io/), which comes
with an expressive command-line syntax. We recommend to study the [HTTPie
documentation](https://httpie.io/docs/cli/examples) to understand the full
extent of the command-line interface. In many cases, you can perform an *exact*
copy of the HTTPie command line and use it drop-in with the HTTP loader, e.g.,
the invocation

```bash
http PUT pie.dev/put X-API-Token:123 foo=bar
```

becomes

```
from http PUT pie.dev/put X-API-Token:123 foo=bar
```

More generally, if your HTTPie command line is `http X` then you can write `from
http X` to obtain an event stream or `load http X` for a byte stream.

### `--chunked`

Enable [chunked transfer
encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunked_transfer_encoding). This is
equivalent to manually setting the header `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`.

### `--multipart`

Encodes the HTTP request body as [multipart
message](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME#Multipart_messages).

This automatically sets the `Content-Type` header to
`application/form-multipart; X` where `X` contains the MIME part boundary.

### `-f|--form`

Submits the HTTP request body as form.

This automatically sets the `Content-Type` header to
`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

### `-j|--json`

Explicitly sets the `Accept` header to `application/json`.

### `<method>`

The HTTP method, such as `POST` or `GET`.

The argument is optional and its default value depends on the command line:

- `GET` for requests without body
- `POST` for requests with body

For example, the following operator configurations are identical:

```
from http GET pie.dev/get
from http pie.dev/get
```

Similarly, when we provide data for the request body, the following two
invocations are identical:

```
from http POST pie.dev/post foo=bar
from http pie.dev/post foo=bar
```

### `<url>`

The HTTP request URL.

The scheme is `http://` and can be omitted from the argument. For example, the
following two invocations are identical:

```
from http pie.dev/get
from http http://pie.dev/get
```

### `<item>`

A HTTP request item in the form of a key-value pair.

The character separating the key-value pair determines the semantics of the
item:

- `key:value` a HTTP header with name `key` and value `value`
- `key=value` a data field in the HTTP request body with `key` as string key and
  `value` as string value
- `key:=value` a data field in the HTTP request body with `key` as string key and
  `value` as JSON value

Use `\` to escape characters that shouldn't be treated as separators.

## Examples

Download and process a [CSV](../formats/csv.md) file:

```
from http://example.org/file.csv read csv
```

Process a Zstd-compressed [Zeek TSV](../formats/zeek-tsv.md) file:

```
load http://example.org/gigantic.log.zst
| decompress zstd
| read zeek-tsv
```

Send a HTTP PUT request with a `X-API-Token` header and body of `{"foo": 42}`:

```
from http PUT pie.dev/put X-API-Token:123 foo=42
```

Send pipeline data as request body in a POST request:

```
version | to http://pie.dev/put X-API-Token:123
```

Issue a HTTP GET request every second using an operator modifier for [scheduled
executions](/v4.24/language/operator-modifiers#scheduled-executions).

```
every 1s from http://pie.dev/get
```
