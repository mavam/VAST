# TQL2 Migration

This page answers the most frequently asked questions about TQL2.

### What is TQL2?

TQL2 is the next generation of the Tenzir Query Language for writing pipelines.

### How do I use TQL2?

Start your pipeline with a `// tql2` comment to opt into using the new language.
This is supported for Tenzir v4.19 or newer.

### How do I enable TQL2-only mode?

Set the `TENZIR_TQL2=true` environment variable or start your Tenzir Node with
`tenzir-node --tql2`. This is supported for Tenzir v4.25 or newer.

### When will TQL1 be removed?

TQL2-only mode will be the default in Q1 2025, and TQL1 support will be removed
later in 2025.

### Why create an all-new language?

TQL1 has grown historically. Over time, we identified the following shortcomings
that TQL2 fixes:

- Lack of composable expressions, in particular functions and arithmetic
  operations.
- Absence of nested pipelines, which was partially worked around with
  operator modifiers.
- Context-dependent grammar for operators that was unintuitive for users, and
  close to impossible to parse and syntax-highlight.
- Inability to define constants with `let`, and also soon types, functions, and
  custom operators within the pipeline definition directly.
- Lack of control flow within a pipeline like `if { â€¦ } else { â€¦ }` made it
  unnecessarily hard to work with your data.

### Can I mix-and-match TQL1 and TQL2?

Yes! The `legacy` operator takes a string as an argument that is parsed as a
TQL1 pipeline and then replaces itself with it. For example:

```tql
metrics "cpu"
where timestamp > now() - 1h
sort timestamp
// Use the `chart` operator from TQL1
legacy "chart area"
```

### When should I upgrade?

Yesterday! TQL2 is the future of Tenzir, and we are committed to making it the
best-in-class language for writing data pipelines.
