## Connectivity

### A node does not connect to the platform

After you've followed the instructions to [deploy a
node](installation/deploy-a-node/README.md), the node does not show up in the
platform.

Here's what you can do:

1. Ensure that your firewall allows outbound 443/TCP traffic.
2. Start the node manually on the command line via `tenzir-node` and observe the
   output. In case you see a warning or an error, share it with us.

### A node fails to connect with `system_error: failed to resolve`

You may see this error message when a node attempts to connect to the platform:

```
platform-client failed to connect: !! system_error: failed to connect: !! system_error: failed to resolve; will retry in 2m
```

This can happen when additional name servers for custom domains are configured
in your `/etc/resolv.conf`. This is commonly referred to as [Split
DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-horizon_DNS). The name resolution
algorithm in our official Linux binaries does not support such a setup natively.
A split DNS setup is best implemented by using a local caching nameserver such
as [dnsmasq](https://thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html) or
[systemd-resolved](https://systemd.io/RESOLVED-VPNS/).
