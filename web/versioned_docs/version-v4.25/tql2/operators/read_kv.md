# read_kv

Read Key-Value pairs from a byte stream.

```tql
read_kv [field_split:string, value_split:string, merge=bool, raw=bool, quotes=string,
         schema=string, selector=string, schema_only=bool, unflatten=string]
```

## Description

The `read_kv` operator transforms a byte stream into a event stream by parsing
the bytes as Key-Value pairs.

Incoming strings are first split into fields according to `field_split`. This
can be a regular expression. For example, the input `foo: bar, baz: 42` can be
split into `foo: bar` and `baz: 42` with the `r",\s*"` (a comma, followed by any
amount of whitespace) as the field splitter. Note that the matched separators
are removed when splitting a string.

Afterwards, the extracted fields are split into their key and value by
`<value_split>`, which can again be a regular expression. In our example,
`r":\s*"` could be used to split `foo: bar` into the key `foo` and its value
`bar`, and similarly `baz: 42` into `baz` and `42`. The result would thus be
`{"foo": "bar", "baz": 42}`. If the regex matches multiple substrings, only the
first match is used.

The supported regular expression syntax is
[RE2](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax). In particular, this means that
lookahead `(?=...)` and lookbehind `(?<=...)` are not supported by `kv` at the
moment. However, if the regular expression has a capture group, it is assumed
that only the content of the capture group shall be used as the separator. This
means that unsupported regular expressions such as `(?=foo)bar(?<=baz)` can be
effectively expressed as `foo(bar)baz` instead.

### Quoted Values

The parser is aware of double-quotes (`"`). If the `field_split` or
`value_split` are found within enclosing quotes, they are not considered
matches. This means that both the key and the value may be enclosed in
double-quotes.

For example, given `\s*,\s*` and `=`, the input

```
"key"="nested = value",key2="value, and more"
```
will parse as
```json
{
  "key": "nested = value"
}
{
  "key2": "value, and more"
}
```

### `field_split: string (optional)`

The regular expression used to separate individual fields.

Defaults to `r"\s"`.

### `value_split: string (optional)`

The regular expression used to separate a key from its value.

Defaults to `"="`.

### `merge = bool (optional)`

Merges all incoming events into a single schema\* that converges over time. This
option is usually the fastest *for reading* highly heterogeneous data, but can
lead to huge schemas filled with nulls and imprecise results. Use with caution.

\*: In selector mode, only events with the same selector are merged.

This option can not be combined with `raw=true, schema=<schema>`.

### `quotes = string (optional)`

A string of not escaped characters that are supposed to be considered as quotes.

Defaults to the characters `"'`.

### `raw = bool (optional)`

Use only the raw types that are native to the parsed format. In the case of KV
this means that no parsing of data takes place at all and every value remains a
string.

If a known `schema` is given, fields will still be parsed according to the
schema.

Use with caution.

### `schema = string (optional)`

Provide the name of a schema to be used by the parser.

If a schema with a matching name is installed, the result will always have all
fields from that schema.
* Fields that are specified in the schema, but did not appear in the input will
  be null.
* Fields that appear in the input, but not in the schema will also be kept.
`schema_only=true` can be used to reject fields that are not in the schema.

If the given schema does not exist, this option instead assigns the output
schema name only.

The `schema` option is incompatible with the `selector` option.

### `selector = string (optional)`

Designates a field value as schema name with an optional dot-separated prefix.

The string is parsed as `<fieldname>[:<prefix>]`. The `prefix` is optional and
will be prepended to the field value to generate the schema name.

For example, the Suricata EVE JSON format includes a field `event_type` that
contains the event type. Setting the selector to `event_type:suricata` causes an
event with the value `flow` for the field `event_type` to map onto the schema
`suricata.flow`.

The `selector` option is incompatible with the `schema` option.

### `schema_only = bool (optional)`

When working with an existing schema, this option will ensure that the output
schema has *only* the fields from that schema. If the schema name is obtained
via a `selector` and it does not exist, this has no effect.

This option requires either `schema` or `selector` to be set.

### `unflatten = string (optional)`

A delimiter that, if present in keys, causes values to be treated as values of
nested records.

A popular example of this is the [Zeek JSON](read_zeek_json.md) format. It
includes the fields `id.orig_h`, `id.orig_p`, `id.resp_h`, and `id.resp_p` at
the top-level. The data is best modeled as an `id` record with four nested
fields `orig_h`, `orig_p`, `resp_h`, and `resp_p`.

Without an unflatten separator, the data looks like this:

```json title="Without unflattening"
{
  "id.orig_h": "1.1.1.1",
  "id.orig_p": 10,
  "id.resp_h": "1.1.1.2",
  "id.resp_p": 5
}
```

With the unflatten separator set to `.`, Tenzir reads the events like this:

```json title="With 'unflatten'"
{
  "id": {
    "orig_h": "1.1.1.1",
    "orig_p": 10,
    "resp_h": "1.1.1.2",
    "resp_p": 5
  }
}
```

## Examples

### Read comma-separated key-value pairs

```tql
// Input: surname:"John Norman", family_name:Smith, date_of_birth: 1995-05-26
read_kv r"\s*,\s*", r"\s*:\s*"
```

```tql
{
  surname: "John Norman",
  family_name: "Smith",
  date_of_birth: 1995-05-26,
}
```

### Extract key-value pairs with more complex rules

```tql
// Input: PATH: C:\foo INPUT_MESSAGE: hello world
read_kv r"(\s+)[A-Z][A-Z_]+:", r":\s*"
```

```tql
{
  PATH: "C:\\foo",
  INPUT_MESSAGE: "hello world",
}
```

This requires lookahead because not every whitespace acts as a field separator.
Instead, we only want to split if the whitespace is followed by `[A-Z][A-Z_]+:`,
i.e., at least two uppercase characters followed by a colon. We can express this
as `"(\s+)[A-Z][A-Z_]+:"`, which yields `PATH: C:\foo` and `INPUT_MESSAGE: hello
world`. We then split the key from its value with `":\s*"`. Since only the first
match is used to split key and value, this leaves the path intact.
