The `export` command retrieves a subset of data according to a given query
expression. The export format must be explicitly specified:

```bash
vast export [options] <format> [options] [<query>]
```

This is easiest explained on an example:

```bash
vast export --max-events=100 --continuous json ':timestamp < 1 hour ago'
```

The above command outputs line-delimited JSON like this, showing one event per
line:

```json
{"ts": "2020-08-06T09:30:12.530972", "nodeid": "1E96ADC85ABCA4BF7EE5440CCD5EB324BEFB6B00#85879", "aid": 9, "actor_name": "pcap-reader", "key": "source.start", "value": "1596706212530"}
```

The above command signals the running server to export 100 events to the
`export` command, and to do so continuously (i.e., not matching data that was
previously imported). Only events that have a field of type `timestamp` will be
exported, and only if the timestamp in that field is older than 1 hour ago from
the current time at the node.

The default mode of operation for the `export` command is historical queries,
which exports data that was already archived and indexed by the node. The
`--unified` flag can be used to export both historical and continuous data.

For more information on the query expression, see the [query language
documentation](https://docs.tenzir.com/vast/query-language/overview).

The `<query>` expression may be provided on stdin, from a file or from
the command line. Specifying any two conflicting ways of reading the query
results in an error. Not providing a query causes VAST to export everything.

The table below gives an overview of all valid cases:

```
vast export <format> <query>
  //   takes the query from the command line
vast export -r - <format>
  //   reads the query from stdin.
echo "query" | vast export <format>
  //   reads the query from stdin
vast <query.txt export <format>
  //   reads the query from `query.txt`
vast export <format>
  //   export everything
 ```


Some export formats have format-specific options. For example, the `pcap` export
format has a `--flush-interval` option that determines after how many packets
the output is flushed to disk. A list of format-specific options can be
retrieved using the `vast export <format> help`, and individual documentation is
available using `vast export <format> documentation`.
