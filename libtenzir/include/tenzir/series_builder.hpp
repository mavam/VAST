/// An adaptive builder suited for the row-wise creation of series.
///
/// This class is mostly used to build table slices, but it can also be used to
/// construct arbitrary series. The type of the series is iteratively upgraded
/// whenever possible, for example when new fields are added to a record.
///
/// The four main construction methods are `.record()`, `.field(name)`,
/// `.list()`, and `.atom(value)`. The handles returned for the construction of
/// nested objects become invalidated once a method is called on one of their
/// parents. For example, `auto r = builder.record()` is not valid anymore after
/// another record has been created with `auto s = builder.record()`. All
/// handles and the main builder itself can be moved freely without invalidation.
///
/// It can happen that type conflicts arise. For example, a field can be a
/// string in one element of the series, but a record in another. These
/// conflicts are normally solved by flushing previous events into their own
/// table slice, which is why `.finish()` returns a vector of table slices. The
/// data of the element that is still being built is retained while flushing.
/// Furthermore, the builder resets its internal state such that it matches the
/// state that the builder would have if the current event was added to a fresh
/// instance of the builder. This makes so that we avoid unnecessary type
/// conflicts in events further down the line.
///
/// However, some type conflicts can not be resolved in that way. This happens
/// if the type conflict is between elements of a list inside a single series
/// element. In that case, we convert the conflicting values into a string. For
/// example, `[{a: []}, {a: 42}]` becomes `[{a: "[]"}, {a: "42"}]`. This is the
/// only way to resolve the conflict without loss of data because we do not have
/// union types. The builder is currently always flushed before and after this
/// kind of conflict occurs.
///
/// Finally, the builder can be initialized with a type. This directly creates
/// the necessary sub-builders, instead of lazily discovering them. Furthermore,
/// the state associated with the type is not reset when the builder is flushed.
/// New fields can still be added and are removed again when flushing. The
/// `.is_protected()` method returns true if the associated builder was created
/// as part of the preparation for the given type. At the moment, the user of
/// this API must ensure that they do not cause a type conflict within a
/// protected builder, as this will trigger an assertion. This can be done by
/// checking `.kind()` before calling the builder method. In the future, we
/// could change the API to return an error in this case, or we could
/// temporarily change the type according to the normal rules and reset it
/// afterwards.
