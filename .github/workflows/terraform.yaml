# This CI configuration has multiple dependencies:
# - You need an AWS account with a user having sufficient IAM access to run
#   the Terraform scripts. Its credentials should be set in the repository
#   secrets as AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.
# - You need to choose an AWS region and a VPC within that region. These
#   should be configured in the repository secrets as AWS_REGION and
#   PEERED_VPC_ID.
# - The VAST deployment creates a new VPC. Its CIDR should not overlap an
#   existing one in your account. Configure it in the repository secrets as
#   VAST_CIDR
# - The CI run uses Terraform Cloud to store the state. Once you have an
#   account setup, configure its organization name and the desired workspace
#   in the repository secrets as TF_ORGANIZATION and TF_WORKSPACE. You also
#   need the API key from Terraform cloud and set it in TF_API_TOKEN

# Notes:
# - If this workflow is executed multiple times at in parallel, the Terraform
#   state will be protected against inconsistencies by the lock provided by
#   Terraform Cloud but the other tests will result in undefined behavior.
# - If Terraform fails or is interrupted during deployment or destruction, the
#   state might end up locked and subsequent runs will fail. In this case the
#   state first needs to be unlocked, for instance from the Terraform Cloud UI.

# Set these secrets to configure the CI run
