The `put` operator is the new companion to the existing `extend` and `replace`
operators. It specifies the output fields exactly, referring either to input
fields with an extractor, metadata with a selector, or a fixed value.

The `extend` and `replace` operators now support assigning extractors and
selectors in addition to just fixed values.
