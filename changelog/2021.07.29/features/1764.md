Plugin versions are now unique to facilitate debugging. They consist of three
optional parts: The CMake project version of the plugin, the Git revision of
the last commit that touched the plugin, and a `dirty` suffix for uncommited
changes to the plugin. Plugin developers no longer need to specify the version
manually in the plugin entrypoint.
