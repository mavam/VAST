The newly added aggregation function `over` computes another aggregation
function per unique non-null value of an expression, returning a record with the
values lifted into field names of the returned record and their corresponding
aggregated values. In essence, the aggregation functions modifies an existing
aggregation function to do another grouping, and also allows for pivoting
columns into rows.
