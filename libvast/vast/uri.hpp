/// > The generic URI syntax consists of a hierarchical sequence of
/// > components referred to as the scheme, authority, path, query, and
/// > fragment.
/// >
/// >    URI         = scheme ":" hier-part [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ]
/// >
/// >    hier-part   = "//" authority path-abempty
/// >                / path-absolute
/// >                / path-rootless
/// >                / path-empty
/// >
/// > The scheme and path components are required, though the path may be
/// > empty (no characters).  When authority is present, the path must
/// > either be empty or begin with a slash ("/") character.  When
/// > authority is not present, the path cannot begin with two slash
/// > characters ("//").  These restrictions result in five different ABNF
/// > rules for a path (Section 3.3), only one of which will match any
/// > given URI reference.
/// >
/// >
/// > The following are two example URIs and their component parts:
/// >
/// >        foo://example.com:8042/over/there?name=ferret#nose
