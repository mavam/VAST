## What is Tenzir?

Tenzir is a distributed platform for processing and storing security event data
in a pipeline dataflow model, providing the following abstractions:

- Tenzir's **pipelines** consist of powerful operators that perform computations
  over [Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org) data frames. The [Tenzir Query Language
  (TQL)](https://docs.tenzir.com/next/language) makes it easy to express
  pipelinesâ€”akin to Splunk and Kusto.
- Tenzir's indexed **storage engine** persists dataflows in an open format
  ([Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) &
  [Feather](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/feather.html)) so that you can
  access them with any query engine, or run pipelines over selective historical
  workloads.
- Tenzir **nodes** offer a managed runtime for pipelines and storage.
- Interconnected nodes form a **data fabric** and pipelines can span across them
  to implement sophisticated security architectures.

## What can I do with Tenzir?

Use Tenzir if you want to:

- Filter, shape, and enrich events before they hit your SIEM or data lake
- Normalize, enrich, aggregate, and deduplicate structured event data
- Store, compact, and search event data in an open storage format
- Operationalize threat intelligence for live and retrospective detection
- Build your own security data lake
- Create a federated detection and response architectures
