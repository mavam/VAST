# Tries to find Broker library and headers
#
# Usage of this module as follows:
#
#     find_package(Broker)
#
# Variables used by this module, they can change the default behaviour and need
# to be set before calling find_package:
#
#  BROKER_ROOT_DIR           Set this variable to the root installation of
#                            Broker if the module has problems finding the
#                            proper installation path.
#
# Variables defined by this module:
#
#  BROKER_FOUND              System has Broker library
#  BROKER_LIBRARY            The broker library
#  BROKER_INCLUDE_DIRS       The broker headers
